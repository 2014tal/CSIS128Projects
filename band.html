	<h3>Albums</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>The Sickness - The bands most successful album and the first one they ever released. I'd reccomend it to anyone who likes heavy metal and hard rock.</li>
		<li>Believe - The band second album and a bit of a departure from their usual style. The album includes more melodic pieces that complment the hard rock and overall is an excellent album.</li>
		<li>Immortalized - The bands newest album. Released to mixed reception, this is the band leased well preforming album to date, but includes a few good songs in their normal style. </li>
	</ul>
